# DungeonX, what is it?
A minecraft client oriented towards Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons and optimized for it.
## Download the client
Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/DxxxxY/DungeonX/releases) tab to download the client jar file.
## Installing the client
There is no installer yet, so you must drag the 2 files from the [Releases](https://github.com/DxxxxY/DungeonX/releases) tab to your `.minecraft/versions` folder in a new folder that you can name `DungeonX-1.8`. Then, simply select the version by creating a new installation in the mc launcher and selecting this version.
